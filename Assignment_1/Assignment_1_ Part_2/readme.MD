##Semi-supervised learning
 supervised learning training data very few labeled examples & large number of unlabeled examples.
- unlabelled data may require use/inspiration unsupervised methods (clustering and density estimation) 


##Target
In this colab, I will illustrate how Semi-supervised learning works through a simple example based on the credit_card_data.

##Results
TensorBoard live at: https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/NBtoBFeWSN2dMjdvAXF5ng/
