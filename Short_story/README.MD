## (Proposal of the short story)                                                                                                      
                                                                                                         
[Deep learning] is a part of machine learning that learns data representations. Many of the fundamental tasks (with appropriate reformulation) in deep learning are relevant to a much broader array of domains, and in particular, have tremendous potential in aiding the investigation of central scientific questions. There are many different Applications and Implementation of deep learning in different fields.

The Application and Implementation of deep learning in more and more wise fields is a hot topic in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. There have been many relevant studies on how to correctly select a deep learning approach. The proposal aims to propose a short story about the application and implementation of different deep learning. According to the author of the article "A Survey of Deep Learning for Scientific Discovery " (source: [!link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11755.pdf)), numerous studies have been published resulting in various models in the field of deep learning (DL) has recently begun to receive Widely concerned, this is mainly due to its better performance than the classic model.In recent years, most of the fundamental breakthroughs in the core problems of machine learning have been driven by the progress of deep neural networks.

To supplement the information in this short story, other resources explaining the application and implementation of deep learning in different fields will be used. In addition, other sources will be used to compare the application of the deep learning (DL)  field to other studies on similar topics. For example, the short story will include other papers in this field, such as the newest application and implementation of Meta-Learning, to compare with other existing studies.

The short story's structure and format will begin with the introduction of Deep Learning, then briefly introduce existing research on application and implementation of DL that have been published for several years, and then introduce the emerging technologies for DL. While discussing the overall quality of the application and implementation, this short story will also explain the whole situation of  DL application and the source papers have used for other research, as well as the critique of the paper, what can be done to improve and future directions and suggestions.
